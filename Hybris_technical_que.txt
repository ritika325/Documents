### Core Concepts & Architecture

**Q1. What are the different layers in the Hybris architecture?**
**A:** Hybris architecture consists of several layers:
- **Presentation Layer:** JSPs, SmartEdit, WCMS components
- **Business/Service Layer:** Contains business logic, services, and facades
- **DAO Layer:** Direct interaction with the database using FlexibleSearch
- **Persistence Layer:** Jalo or model-layer code with itemtypes.xml mapping
- Each layer is loosely coupled and follows Spring dependency injection.

**Q2. How do you define a new itemtype and generate its model class?**
**A:**
- Define the itemtype in the `items.xml`.
- Run `ant clean all` to generate model classes.
- Best practice: Use `deployment` tag properly and modularize itemtypes by extensions.

**Q3. Explain the concept of FlexibleSearch.**
**A:** FlexibleSearch is Hybris's SQL-like querying language used to query items from the database. It allows joining itemtypes, filtering with conditions, and can use predefined FlexibleSearch queries from `*-flexible-search.xml` files.
